# DJMAX Random Selector V

## !!! READ THIS !!! Not Available because of External Issue !!! READ THIS !!!

For some unknown reason, macro does not work except for the alphabet in DJMAX RESPECT V only.<br>
Because of that, **selection is not working right.**<br>
The issue suddenly occured after DMRV Season 6 Update.<br>
I tried my best, but there was no solution.<br>
Thus, **please wait for that DMRV fixes the issue.**<br>
